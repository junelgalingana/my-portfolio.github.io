        <h1>WHAT IS NAYON NG KABATAAN?</h1>
        <P>Nayon ng Kabataan is a 24-hour residential care facility that provides temporary shelter, psychosocial care, interventions, and protection to children ages 7 to 18 years old who have been abandoned, neglected, and orphaned.<br><br>
        The beginnings of Nayon ng Kabataan goes way back, to 1917, when Republic Act 2671 was passed and the first government orphanage was established at WelfareVille Compound in Mandaluyong. In 1968, the orphanage was relocated at MIA Road, CAA Compound, Pasay City and became known as Nayon ng Kabataan (NK).<br><br>
        Years later, in 2001, Nayon ng Kabataan relocated back to its former address at WelfareVille Compound, Mandaluyong City. The following year, in coordination with Lions Street Children Foundation, Inc. (LSCFI), a sponsored cottage called Cottage 3 – Bahay Magalang was inaugurated; it accommodated some street children and staff from Ahon Bata Center.</P>
